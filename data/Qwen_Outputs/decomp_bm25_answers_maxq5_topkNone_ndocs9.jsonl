Given that the context mentions Frank Zappa's third studio album under Warner Bros.

Nonetheless, sticking strictly to the information provided about Dismal Euphony, the vocalist of Dismal Euphony is Ole K. Helgesen, who took over as the singer/bassist after Erik Borgen left the band. However, if the question is asking about a broader context and referencing Frank Zappa, then the answer would be Frank Zappa, who was the vocalist for the band that made significant commercial progress under Warner Bros.

However, the context does mention Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump, which serialized many popular manga series including Raw Hero. Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump was launched in 1968 and it has been running continuously since then. As for the founder of the publishing company of Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump, Akira Toriyama is not the founder of the publishing company but rather a famous manga artist whose works were published in Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump. The founder of the publishing company is Shueisha, which is a Japanese publishing company. Since the question asks for Akira Toriyama's age when Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump ended publication, and as the magazine is still running, we can only infer the age based on the current year. Akira Toriyama was born in 1955, so if we consider the current year (2023), he would be 68 years old. However, if the question is interpreted as asking about the age of the founder of Shueisha when Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump ended publication, we do not have enough information to determine the age of the founder of Shueisha or when the magazine would have hypothetically ended publication. Therefore, the provided context does not give a precise answer to the question as posed. If the intention was to ask about Akira Toriyama's age relative to the magazine's operation, then in 2023, Akira Toriyama would be 68 years old."}

However, the provided context does not contain this specific information. We can infer the companies based on the ticker symbols but will need to look up the employee numbers separately.\n\nThe company alphabetically first by ticker symbol in the S&P500 is AAL (American Airlines Group Inc.), and the company alphabetically second to last is WLTW (Walt Disney Company, as of the time of writing, but given the context, it could be another company like WABCO Holdings Inc. or WEX Inc., which are alphabetically near the end).\n\nSince the context does not provide the employee numbers for American Airlines Group Inc. and the company alphabetically second to last, we cannot directly extract the required information from the given text.\n\nHowever, based on publicly available data:\n\n1. **American Airlines Group Inc.** (Ticker: AAL) employs around 110,000 people (as of 2021).\n   \n2. **Walt Disney Company** (Ticker: DIS) employs around 220,300 people (as of 2021).\n\nIf we assume the question is asking about the Walt Disney Company (DIS) as the company alphabetically second to last (since Disney is a major company often listed near the end), then we can calculate the difference:\n\n220,300 (Disney) - 110,000 (American Airlines) = 110,300\n\nTherefore, as of 2021, Walt Disney Company has approximately 110,300 more employees than American Airlines Group Inc. Please note that these numbers are based on publicly available data and may have changed since then. For the most accurate and current information, one would need to refer to the latest employee reports from each company."}

It also mentions that Haller won the Eredivisie (the Eredevisie likely refers to Eredivisie) in the 2020-21 season while playing for Ajax. Furthermore, the context states that Haller began his career in France with Auxerre. However, there is no explicit mention of Haller scoring more than 15 goals specifically in the 2021-22 Eredivisie season. The closest information is from the 2020-21 season, where he won the Eredivisie title and presumably scored a significant number of goals.

The only player with a high number of sacks mentioned in the context is defensive end Derek Smith from the Kansas City Chiefs, but this is not the Derek Smith born in 1946. The player born in 1946 who had a high number of sacks is presumably referring to defensive end Charles Mann, but there's no mention of his total league appearances or the specific percentage in question. The closest player to Derek Smith born in 1946 who fits the criteria of having a high number of sacks and being associated with the Cardinals is probably the defensive end Bruce Smith who played for the Washington Redskins and then the Cardinals. Bruce Smith recorded a franchise single-season record of 18.5 sacks in 1986. However, Bruce Smith was born in 1963 and not 1946. \n\nGiven the confusion and lack of direct information regarding Derek Smith born in 1946 and his specific league appearances with the Cardinals, it's not possible to accurately answer the question with the provided context. The document does mention Bruce Smith's record of 18.5 sacks in a single season, but does not provide the total number of league appearances to calculate a percentage. \n\nTherefore, the provided information does not allow for a precise answer to the question as formulated.

However, the question seems to refer to an actor named Hart who appeared in a miniseries based on a historical novel about World War II with a three-word title. Given the information, this likely refers to \"The Winds of War\" miniseries, which was adapted from Herman Wouk's novel of the same name. But there is no actor by the name of Hart who starred in this miniseries. \n\nThe second part of the question mentions an author who wrote a book about a kid with the last name of Bookbinder. This refers to Herman Wouk, who wrote \"City Boy: The Adventures of Herbie Bookbinder\". However, Herman Wouk did not act in any miniseries.\n\nTherefore, the context provided does not directly answer the question as there is no specific actor named Hart who acted in \"The Winds of War\" miniseries based on Herman Wouk's novel. The correct interpretation might be seeking an actor who appeared in such a miniseries, but the name Hart is not mentioned in the context provided."}

provided information.\n\nFirst, the context mentions that the fastest fish swimming speed is uncertain and conflicting, but it caps at 36 km/h (kilometers per hour) due to physical constraints. Let's convert 36 km/h to meters per second (m/s):\n\n\\[ 36 \\text{ km/h} = \\frac{36 \\times 1000}{3600} \\text{ m/s} = 10 \\text{ m/s} \\]\n\nNext, the fastest record for swimming the 50m freestyle in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics needs to be identified. The fastest time for the 50m freestyle event in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics was set by Caeleb Dressel of the United States with a time of 21.07 seconds.\n\nNow, let's calculate the speed in m/s:\n\n\\[ \\text{Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}} = \\frac{50 \\text{ m}}{21.07 \\text{ s}} \\approx 2.37 \\text{ m/s} \\]\n\nFinally, we find the difference between the fastest fish swimming speed and the fastest 50m freestyle swim time in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics:\n\n\\[ 10 \\text{ m/s} - 2.37 \\text{ m/s} = 7.63 \\text{ m/s} \\]\n\nTherefore, the difference is approximately 7.63 meters per second."}

The mean flow rate of the River Marden is given as 2.6 m\u00b3/s (from the Hydrology section of the River Marden content). \n\nTo convert the mean flow rate of the River Marden from cubic meters per second (m\u00b3/s) to cubic feet per second (ft\u00b3/s):\n1 m\u00b3/s = 35.3147 ft\u00b3/s\nTherefore, the mean flow rate of the River Marden is approximately 91.8 ft\u00b3/s (2.6 * 35.3147).\n\nGiven that the mean flow rate of the River Avon at Great Somerford is between 2 and 10 ft\u00b3/s, the difference in mean flow rate between the River Avon and the River Marden would be somewhere between 81.8 ft\u00b3/s (91.8 - 10) and 89.8 ft\u00b3/s (91.8 - 2) if we consider the extremes of the range for the River Avon's flow rate. However, if we take the mean of the River Avon's flow rate range, which is 6 ft\u00b3/s, the difference would be around 85.8 ft\u00b3/s (91.8 - 6). \n\nThus, the difference in mean flow rate between the River Avon at Great Somerford and the River Marden would be approximately 85.8 ft\u00b3/s, assuming the mean flow rate of the River Avon is 6 ft\u00b3/s.

The headquarters of the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) were opened in 1981. Ignoring the month either event occurred, the headquarters for the AIS were opened 2 years before Ben Darwin's birth, not after. Therefore, the correct interpretation of the question would be that Ben Darwin graduated from the AIS approximately 2 years after the AIS headquarters were opened, assuming he started his training there shortly after his birth or at a very young age and progressed to a level where he could graduate within a couple of years of the AIS headquarters opening. However, the exact number of years after his birth when the AIS headquarters were opened is 0, as he was born 2 years after the headquarters were opened. If the intent was to ask how many years after the AIS headquarters were opened Darwin graduated, more specific information about his graduation year from the AIS would be needed. Given the context provided, the answer focuses on the timeline of the AIS's establishment relative to Darwin's birth year."}

Thus, in 2007, Cinthia Pi\u00f1eiro was 1 year older than Ysaires Restituyo's 2009 partner Ana Ligia Fabian Hern\u00e1ndez, since Ana Ligia would not have been born yet in 2007. \n\nHowever, the more precise calculation for the question asked (how much older was her 2007 partner than her 2009 partner) is as follows: Cinthia Pi\u00f1eiro was 1 year and 8 months older than Ana Ligia Fabian Hern\u00e1ndez when they were partners with Ysaires Restituyo in 2007 and 2009, respectively.

The exact 2021 population figure is not provided in the given context, but based on the trend and available data, it would be around 517,535 or slightly adjusted according to the population change in the province between 2019 and 2021.\n\nThe leader of the party that won the 1869 Newfoundland general election was Sir William Whiteway, who was not directly involved in that election but was a prominent political figure in the later period. The election itself was won by the Anti-Confederates, which were led by Charles Fox Bennett at the time. Given that the specific population figure for 2021 is not mentioned, the closest relevant population data is from 2019. Therefore, the population of the birthplace of Charles Fox Bennett, which is the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, can be approximated as being close to 517,535 in 2021."}

However, it's important to clarify that the question seems to mix timelines and roles. Derek Dougan was born in 1938, while \"Ben-Hur\" was released in 1959. The chairman referred to in the context of the 1982\u201383 Wolverhampton Wanderers season is Derek Dougan himself, who fronted a consortium to save the club in 1982. Therefore, there isn't a direct correlation between a William Wyler film and the birth year of the chairman mentioned for the 1982\u201383 season of Wolverhampton Wanderers. If you are asking about a specific William Wyler film and the birth year of Derek Dougan, the answer would be that Derek Dougan was born in 1938, and none of William Wyler's films debuted that year. The closest match would be \"The Big Country\" (1958) and \"Friendly Persuasion\" (1956), but neither of these films debuted in 1938.

Given that the novel is not specifically noted to have a distinct narrator character but rather focuses on Timothy Archer and his experiences and reflections, the novel doesn't have a traditional narrator character like some of Dick's other works. Therefore, it's not possible to definitively identify a specific narrator character from \"The Transmigration of Timothy Archer\" based on the information provided.

In a 2021 animated movie, Dax Shepard provided the voice for the character \"The Manotaur\" in the film Sing. However, the question seems to be asking about a specific character voice for a 2021 animated movie, and based on the information provided, the correct answer is that Dax Shepard did not voice a character named \"The Manotaur\" in a 2021 animated movie, but rather Kristen Bell's husband, Dax Shepard, had a voice role in the animated film Sing in 2016, as part of the film's soundtrack, and not in a 2021 animated movie. Therefore, there appears to be a mismatch in the question's timeline or character identification. If the query is specifically about a 2021 animated movie, additional information is required to accurately identify the character Dax Shepard voiced. However, if the reference is to the 2016 animated film Sing, Dax Shepard indeed provided a voice for a character named \"The Manotaur\" in that film."}

However, based on the information available, we can infer the following:\n\nNovak Djokovic was the runner-up in the 2016 Australian Open, losing to Andy Murray. Andy Murray was ranked world No. 1 at the time of the 2016 French Open, as he had overtaken Djokovic in the rankings due to his performance in the early part of the season.\n\nRegarding their head-to-head, Djokovic and Murray have met 36 times, with Djokovic leading 25\u201311. However, at the time of the 2016 French Open, Murray had recently defeated Djokovic in the semi-finals of the 2016 Miami Open and the 2016 Indian Wells Masters, and also in the 2016 Australian Open final. Therefore, Djokovic's lead in head-to-head was likely to have decreased slightly, but the exact head-to-head score at the end of the 2016 French Open is not specified in the provided information.\n\nThus, while Djokovic led the head-to-head overall, the specific head-to-head score at the conclusion of the 2016 French Open is not definitively stated in the text. The most recent information provided indicates Djokovic's overall lead, but not the updated score at that particular time."}

The correct player being referenced, based on the timeline and Hall of Fame induction, is likely to be Lefty Grove, who was born in 1900 and died on March 4, 1975, and was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1947.\n\nSix years after Grove's induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame (1947 + 6 = 1953), the only person inducted that year was Lou Gehrig. Lou Gehrig had a total of 2,722 career wins, considering his wins are counted as part of the New York Yankees team success during his career from 1923 to 1939. However, it's important to clarify that the number of career wins typically refers to a pitcher's total wins, not a batter's. Lou Gehrig was a batter and not known for having career wins in the sense that a pitcher would. \n\nLefty Grove, the player being referred to in the context of the Athletics, had 200 total career wins as a pitcher. Therefore, the answer to the question is that six years after Lefty Grove's Hall of Fame induction, he had 200 total career wins."}

However, based on the provided context, it seems that the small-mouth salamander is not the correct answer as it is not listed as endangered in Canada and its only Canadian population is on Pelee Island, which is in Ontario, not the southernmost inhabited part of Canada. The information provided in the context about an amphibian species listed as endangered in Canada and inhabiting the southernmost part of Canada isn't directly linked to a specific species. But given the description, it's likely referring to a species found on Pelee Island, which is the southernmost inhabited part of Canada. \n\nSince the question specifies an amphibian listed as endangered by the Canadian government and considering the provided context for Pelee Island, the species in question might be one of the amphibians found there, such as the small-mouth salamander. However, the context doesn't explicitly mention any endangered amphibian species on Pelee Island. \n\nIf we follow the information strictly from the provided context, the only amphibian species mentioned in relation to Pelee Island is the small-mouth salamander (Ambystoma texanum), but it is not listed as endangered in Canada. Therefore, based on the given context, there isn't a direct match for the amphibian species that fits all criteria specified in the question. \n\nThe question may need more specific context or a different amphibian species not mentioned here to find a precise answer. The closest match based on the information provided is the small-mouth salamander, but it does not meet the endangered status criterion in Canada."}

Therefore, the 4th Sheriff of Yorkshire from the House of Plantagenet died in 1390.

However, it's important to note that Naruto Uzumaki is not directly associated with the Geibi Line or any other railway line in the context provided. The question seems to be mixing up contexts as there is no explicit mention of a 'shonen jump' station-sharing character name in the provided text about the Geibi Line or other JR West regional lines. But if we are to consider popular 'shonen jump' characters, Naruto Uzumaki is the most well-known, and there is no other character mentioned that matches the criteria. The station name mentioned in the text does not match any 'shonen jump' series protagonist's name. The closest match in the text is the station name \"Miyoshi,\" but Miyoshi is not a protagonist from a 'shonen jump' series. Therefore, the answer based on the provided information is not directly supported, but if we consider the most famous 'shonen jump' protagonist, the answer would be Naruto Uzumaki. Please clarify your question if you're referring to a specific station name and protagonist match within 'shonen jump' series and JR West lines."}

However, if we are to infer the question is about the Mycenaean rulers succeeding the one in power during the completion of the Treasury of Atreus, we would need to identify the ruler(s) during that period and their immediate successors.\n\nThe context mentions that the tomb was visible in Antiquity but not associated with Atreus or Agamemnon until the 18th century. Given the timeline, the Pharaohs of Egypt during that period wouldn't be the immediate successors to the ruler of Mycenae who oversaw the completion of the Treasury of Atreus. The immediate successors to the Mycenaean rulers would be Mycenaean kings, not Egyptian Pharaohs.\n\nSince the context is more focused on the historical significance and construction of the Treasury of Atreus rather than a direct succession of Mycenaean rulers, we can't pinpoint an exact successor from the given information. However, if we assume the context refers to the ruler of Mycenae during the construction period, his immediate successor would be someone from the Mycenaean lineage, not an Egyptian Pharaoh. The context does not provide names of specific Mycenaean rulers succeeding the one who was in power when the Treasury of Atreus was completed.

Archduke Franz Ferdinand was assassinated on 28 June 1914. Therefore, the racehorse's victory that inspired the band's name occurred approximately 87 years before the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. However, the specific racehorse named \"Archduke Franz Ferdinand\" is not mentioned in the provided context, and the inspiration seems to stem more from the Archduke himself rather than a horse with the same name. If the inspiration is indeed from a racehorse called Archduke that the band watched win a race in 2001, then the racehorse's victory would have happened about 9 years before the historical event that inspired the band's name, which is the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in 1914. But this would be a misinterpretation of the timeline since the racehorse mentioned in the context isn't linked to the Archduke's name. The band's inspiration is clearly linked to the Archduke himself and not a racehorse named after him. So, the racehorse part of the band's name origin doesn't align with the historical timeline given. The correct interpretation is that the band's name is inspired by the Archduke Franz Ferdinand, who was assassinated in 1914, and the racehorse reference seems to be an unrelated detail. Therefore, the racehorse inspiration happened in 2001, about 9 years after the band was named after the Archduke, who was assassinated in 1914. If the racehorse part is disregarded as the direct inspiration, the band was named about 87 years after his assassination. But based strictly on the context provided, the racehorse reference seems to be an event in 2001 that reinforced the band's name choice, not a direct influence on the name itself."}

However, the question seems to be indirectly asking about a specific year related to South African drivers in Formula One. Given that the context mentions South African drivers such as Bruce McLaren, who won in 1960, and Jody Scheckter, who won in 1979, and considering that the micro-nation of Sealand, often associated with Suffolk due to its distance from the coast of England, was established in 1967, the closest year mentioned in the context that aligns with this timeframe is 1979. Therefore, the South African drivers mentioned in the context for 1979 are Jody Scheckter and possibly others like his teammate in the Wolf team, but the specific teammate is not named. Since the question asks for two South African drivers, and only one is clearly named, the answer would be primarily Jody Scheckter, with the second driver possibly being omitted in the text. The context does not provide a clear second South African driver for 1979, so the answer based on the available information is:\n\nJody Scheckter (as a clear mention), and possibly another unnamed teammate in the Wolf team.\n\nPlease note that the exact second South African driver is not specified in the given text for 1979, so the answer is incomplete based on the provided information."}

There is no mention of a specific number of caps won by Chris Oti or Andy Mullins in the provided context, but we can infer that as teammates with Carling and part of the university rugby team, they would have likely won fewer caps. However, the question asks for the number of caps won by the teammates in relation to Carling, and since Carling's caps are the only ones explicitly stated, the answer focusing on the teammates would be an estimate based on the information available. \n\nGiven the constraints of the question, we can only definitively state the number of caps for Will Carling, which is 72. For rounding to the nearest ten, Will Carling's caps would be rounded to 70. Without specific numbers for Chris Oti and Andy Mullins, we cannot provide a combined rounded figure for all three teammates. Thus, the answer is primarily centered on Will Carling's caps as the exact data for the other two teammates is not provided. \n\nTherefore, the number of England caps won by university rugby teammates Will Carling, Chris Oti, and Andy Mullins, focusing on the provided data, is approximately **70** caps, rounding Will Carling's 72 caps to the nearest ten."}

However, considering the details of the question and the information available, the drummer you might be referring to is Brooks Wackerman. Brooks Wackerman was indeed a drummer for Bad Religion, but his tenure was from 2001 to 2015, not 1990 to 2023. Moreover, Brooks is from Los Angeles, which contradicts the condition of being from California but not Los Angeles. Therefore, there seems to be a discrepancy in the timeframe and location provided in the question. If the timeframe was meant to be from 1991 to 2015, then Brooks Wackerman would fit the criteria of being from California (specifically Los Angeles) but doesn't strictly adhere to the \"not from Los Angeles\" condition. If the timeframe was meant to be from 1991 to 2023 and the drummer is still active, then the description does not match any known drummer from Bad Religion. Please clarify the timeframe and location to identify the correct drummer accurately. If we consider the timeframe and location loosely, the answer would be Brooks Wackerman.

Rodney Gordon is mentioned in relation to Target House, a building sold by Standard Life Investments to Albert Hay's Capital and City Group for \u00a310.5 million in 2012.\n2. Peyton Manning, an American former football quarterback, was a Super Bowl MVP in Super Bowl XLI in 2006 and again in Super Bowl 50 in 2016.\n3. Peyton Manning's wife is Ashley Manning.\n\nTherefore, the Super Bowl MVP's wife in 2012, when Target House was sold, would be Ashley Manning, as Peyton Manning won Super Bowl XLI in 2006 and there is no mention of him winning another Super Bowl MVP until 2016. If the question is asking specifically about the year 2012, then the answer would be that there was no Super Bowl MVP from the Manning family that year, and hence no applicable wife mentioned in the context provided. If the question is flexible to the timeframe around 2012, then Ashley Manning would be the correct answer considering Peyton Manning's Super Bowl wins in 2006 and 2016."}

If we strictly adhere to the context provided and The Office, the closest match would be an episode that starts with \"M\" and is directed by Lesli Linka Glatter, but since \"Mysteries\" is not a single word, we cannot definitively conclude it as the answer. \n\nIf we assume the question pertains solely to The Office and the exact one-word episode title requirement, there isn't a clear match in the provided context. Yet, the most likely episode from The Office that Lesli Linka Glatter directed and starts with an \"M\" is \"Mysteries\", even though it doesn't perfectly fit the single-word description. \n\nTherefore, the best answer given the provided context and adherence to the Dorothy Arzner Directors Award connection would be \"Mysteries\", but please note that it doesn't precisely meet the single-word criterion.

However, the information provided states that Minyong Kim, the Kim Jong Un impersonator, is an undergraduate student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Hugh Hefner, the founder of Playboy, graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1949.\n\nGiven that Minyong Kim is currently a student and there is no specific year mentioned for his attendance, we can only determine the difference in years between their graduations if we assume that Minyong Kim has just graduated or is about to graduate. If we take the current year as 2023 and subtract Hefner's graduation year of 1949, it implies that there are approximately 74 years between their respective periods at the university, assuming Kim will graduate in 2023. However, since Kim is still an undergraduate student according to the information provided, the exact number of years separating their time at the university cannot be definitively stated without knowing the specific graduation year of Minyong Kim. Therefore, the answer based on the provided information is approximately 74 years, acknowledging that this is contingent on the assumption that Kim is nearing his graduation in 2023."}

tour in Savannah, GA, you'll want to visit Colonial Park Cemetery and Bonaventure Cemetery. \n\nColonial Park Cemetery is famous for its connection to the book \"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil\" by John Berendt. The book mentions the cemetery and includes it as part of the story's setting. However, the cemetery that is notably featured on the book's cover is Bonaventure Cemetery. The iconic cover photograph featured the Bird Girl statue, which is located in Bonaventure Cemetery.\n\nRegarding another old cemetery downtown, you're likely referring to Colonial Park Cemetery. Victims of the 1820 yellow fever epidemic are buried there. This epidemic took place in 1820 and claimed more than 700 lives in the cemetery."}
