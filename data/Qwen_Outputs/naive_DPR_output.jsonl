However, the nearest state to Washington, D.C., is Maryland.\n\nPunxsutawney, Pennsylvania, is where Punxsutawney Phil resides and makes his predictions. Since Punxsutawney Phil is said to have started making predictions in 1887 according to the lore, and Pennsylvania is not adjacent to Washington, D.C., but Maryland is, we infer the question is asking about the earliest possible state location for a groundhog making a prediction near the U.S. capitol.\n\nThere are no specific mentions of groundhog predictions in Maryland or any other state near Washington, D.C., before Punxsutawney Phil's inception in 1887. Therefore, the question essentially asks how much earlier a similar tradition could have started in a state nearer to the U.S. capitol than Pennsylvania.\n\nSince the tradition began in Pennsylvania in 1887, if it hypothetically started in a state closer to Washington, D.C. (such as Maryland) at the same time, it wouldn't be earlier. But if we consider the possibility of starting the tradition in Maryland earlier, we'd need to estimate a plausible starting date.\n\nHowever, without any historical evidence suggesting an earlier tradition in a state nearer to the capitol, the question's premise is purely speculative. If we assume the earliest possible starting date for such a tradition in a state near the capitol was concurrent with Punxsutawney Phil's inception, then the answer would be zero years.\n\nThus, Punxsutawney Phil would not need to be any earlier in existence to make a prediction in a state near the U.S. capitol; the tradition could have theoretically started in Maryland or another nearby state in 1887 as well. If the question implies an earlier start date, there's no historical data to support this, so we cannot provide a specific number of years."}

However, this does not align with the Pope Pietro Barbo's papacy, indicating there might be a discrepancy in the question's setup.\n\nTo clarify, Pope Pietro Barbo (Paul II) was pope from 1464 to 1471, and he did not notably end a major war during his tenure.
