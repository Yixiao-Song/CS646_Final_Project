However, the nearest state to Washington, D.C., is Maryland.\n\nPunxsutawney, Pennsylvania, is where Punxsutawney Phil resides and makes his predictions. Since Punxsutawney Phil is said to have started making predictions in 1887 according to the lore, and Pennsylvania is not adjacent to Washington, D.C., but Maryland is, we infer the question is asking about the earliest possible state location for a groundhog making a prediction near the U.S. capitol.\n\nThere are no specific mentions of groundhog predictions in Maryland or any other state near Washington, D.C., before Punxsutawney Phil's inception in 1887. Therefore, the question essentially asks how much earlier a similar tradition could have started in a state nearer to the U.S. capitol than Pennsylvania.\n\nSince the tradition began in Pennsylvania in 1887, if it hypothetically started in a state closer to Washington, D.C. (such as Maryland) at the same time, it wouldn't be earlier. But if we consider the possibility of starting the tradition in Maryland earlier, we'd need to estimate a plausible starting date.\n\nHowever, without any historical evidence suggesting an earlier tradition in a state nearer to the capitol, the question's premise is purely speculative. If we assume the earliest possible starting date for such a tradition in a state near the capitol was concurrent with Punxsutawney Phil's inception, then the answer would be zero years.\n\nThus, Punxsutawney Phil would not need to be any earlier in existence to make a prediction in a state near the U.S. capitol; the tradition could have theoretically started in Maryland or another nearby state in 1887 as well. If the question implies an earlier start date, there's no historical data to support this, so we cannot provide a specific number of years."}

This is typically referring to Davy Crockett, who died at the Battle of the Alamo in 1836. However, Crockett was never elected to the US House of Representatives after the Alamo. He was elected to the US House of Representatives in 1828 and re-elected in 1830, serving until 1835.

This information changes frequently, so we would need to check the latest data available as of August 1, 2024. However, for the sake of answering this question, let's assume the current youngest US House Representative is Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who was born on October 13, 1989, and was first elected in 2018 at the age of 29.\n\nNow, let's calculate the age difference:\n\n- Davy Crockett was 41 years old when he was first elected to the US House of Representatives.\n- Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was 29 years old when she was first elected to the US House of Representatives.\n\nThe age difference is 41 - 29 = 12 years.\n\nTherefore, as of August 1, 2024, the current youngest US House Representative is 12 years younger than the American folk hero who died at the Alamo when they were elected to the US House of Representatives."}

However, without the exact number of Afroasiatic language speakers globally or specifically in Morocco, it's challenging to provide an exact percentage. Assuming the broader context that Berber languages collectively account for a significant but minority portion of speakers within the Afroasiatic language family, Central Atlas Tamazight speakers would constitute an even smaller subset of this group.

The Gupta Empire began facing significant Hun invasions around 480 AD, about 24 years after 456 AD (which is considered the end of the Western Roman Empire for some historians).\n3. The Huna (often referred to as Huns) invasions under Toramana and his successor Mihirakula severely impacted the Gupta Empire starting around 480 AD.\n4.

Ramesses II, also known as Ramesses the Great, was a pharaoh of the 19th Dynasty, and his reign was from 1279 to 1213 BCE. Therefore, Ramesses II was not in power when the Treasury of Atreus was completed.\n\nTo identify the successor of the pharaoh in power when the Treasury of Atreus was completed, we need to look at the pharaohs of the 18th and 19th Dynasties who ruled around 1400 to 1200 BCE. The pharaohs during this period were from the 18th Dynasty, as the 19th Dynasty began around 1292 BCE with the reign of Ramesses I.\n\nThe pharaoh who was likely in power when the Treasury of Atreus was completed was Merneptah, the son and successor of Ramesses II. However, Merneptah's reign started in 1213 BCE, which is after the completion period of the Treasury of Atreus.\n\nTherefore, the pharaoh in power when the Treasury of Atreus was completed was likely Ramesses II's predecessor, Seti II, who succeeded Merneptah. But considering the timeline more accurately, the pharaohs of the 18th Dynasty, such as Ramesses I, Seti I, or even Horemheb, would be more fitting. Given the timeframe, Seti II was not the correct successor for the period when the Treasury of Atreus was completed.\n\nTo be precise, the successor of the pharaoh in power when the Treasury of Atreus was completed would be Seti II, who succeeded Merneptah in 1203 BCE, but the pharaoh during the construction would have been Ramesses II's predecessor, likely Seti I (1290\u20131279 BCE) or Horemheb (1319\u20131292 BCE). Given the specific timeframe of 1400 to 1200 BCE, the successor of the pharaoh in power during the construction of the Treasury of Atreus would be Ramesses I, who succeeded Horemheb in 1292 BCE."}

This typically refers to a man named Alexandre Albert, who was indeed the world's oldest father when he had a child at 96 years old in 1999. However, there's no specific information about his career mentioned in the question or provided context.\n\n2. **Man Who Killed His Wife and Son Named Daniel:** The scenario refers to a man named Daniel Sickles, who killed his wife, Teresa Bagioli Sickles, in 1859. However, there is no mention of him having a son named Daniel in the historical records. Sickles was a politician and lawyer who served in the U.S. Congress and was involved in notable historical events, but he did not have a son named Daniel who he killed.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided context, the question does not align with any clear career shared by both individuals.

The distance between the points of the bases in baseball.\n2. The diameter of the pitching plate (\"rubber\") in softball.\n3. The year that Joe DiMaggio married Marilyn Monroe.\n\nFrom the information provided in the articles:\n\n1. In baseball, the distance between the points of the bases is 90 feet.\n2. In softball, the pitching plate (\"rubber\") diameter is not explicitly mentioned. However, the standard distance from the pitching plate to home plate in fastpitch softball is typically around 43 feet, but the diameter of the pitching plate itself is not given. Typically, the pitching plate is a rectangle measuring 24 inches (2 feet) by 17 inches, so the diameter (considering the diagonal of the rectangle) is approximately 3 feet. For simplicity, we can assume the diameter is 3 feet.\n3. Joe DiMaggio married Marilyn Monroe on January 14, 1946.\n\nNow, let's calculate:\n\nDistance between bases in baseball = 90 feet\nDiameter of the pitching plate in softball = 3 feet\nYear Joe DiMaggio married Marilyn Monroe = 1946\n\nSubtract the diameter of the pitching plate from the distance between the bases:\n90 feet - 3 feet = 87 feet\n\nMultiply this result by the year Joe DiMaggio married Marilyn Monroe:\n87 feet * 1946 = 169,602\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the question is 169,602."}

Therefore, 19 years after 2000 is 2019.\n\nFrom the provided demographic information about Paris, the population of Paris in 2019 is not directly stated, but we can interpolate or use the closest available data points. The population of Paris in 2012 was 2,240,621, and by 2017, it had risen to 2,187,526. Given this information, we can reasonably approximate the population of Paris in 2019 to be around 2,200,000.\n\nSecond, the population of Brown County, Kansas, according to the 2020 census, is approximately 16,275.\n\nNow, we calculate how many times larger the population of Paris was compared to Brown County, Kansas, in 2019:\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\text{Population of Paris in 2019}}{\\text{Population of Brown County, Kansas in 2020}} = \\frac{2,200,000}{16,275} \\approx 135.17 \\]\n\nRounded to the nearest whole number, the population of Paris in 2019 was approximately **135** times larger than the population of Brown County, Kansas, according to its 2020 census."}
