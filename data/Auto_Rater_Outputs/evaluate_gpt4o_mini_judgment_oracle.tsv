How many years earlier would Punxsutawney Phil have to be canonically alive to have made a Groundhog Day prediction in the same state as the US capitol?	87	Punxsutawney Phil is said to have been making predictions since 1886. The U.S. Capitol, being in Washington, D.C., means we need to find the nearest state to Washington, D.C., where Groundhog Day predictions occur. The closest state with a significant Groundhog Day prediction tradition is Pennsylvania, where Punxsutawney Phil resides.  Washington, D.C. was established in 1790, so if Punxsutawney Phil were to have hypothetically started making predictions in the same state as the U.S. Capitol (meaning in Pennsylvania) at the same time as the Capitol's establishment, Phil would have had to be canonically alive since 1790 to have made predictions in Pennsylvania from the very beginning of the Capitol's existence.  Thus, Punxsutawney Phil would have to be canonically alive **1886 - 1790 = 96 years earlier** to have made a Groundhog Day prediction in the same state as the U.S. Capitol from its inception.	no
